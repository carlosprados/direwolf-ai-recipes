# OpenGate AI Recipes - Unleash the Power of Customizable ML Workflows

## Overview

**OpenGate Recipes** originated as a fork of the MLflow Recipes project, evolving beyond its initial capabilities. Building on the solid foundation of MLflow Recipes, this project retains familiar features while enhancing and expanding the framework to allow for greater customization, extensibility, and a broader range of machine learning workflows.

Welcome to **OpenGate Recipes**, a bold and innovative solution for simplifying and automating machine learning workflow management. Inspired by the adaptability, strength, and community spirit of the wolf, OpenGate Recipes aims to provide a highly extensible and customizable platform that empowers data scientists and machine learning practitioners to build, share, and execute machine learning pipelines effortlessly. Breaking free from the limitations of traditional ML tools, OpenGate Recipes helps you unleash your creativity and conquer complex challenges with versatile workflows that go far beyond basic classification and regression tasks.

## Why OpenGate Recipes?

**OpenGate Recipes** is designed to address the need for extensibility and flexibility in machine learning workflows. In a world where ML projects are growing increasingly diverse and complex, OpenGate Recipes stands out as the ideal framework for practitioners who need more than just pre-defined workflows. Much like a wolf pack that thrives by adapting to its environment, OpenGate Recipes embraces modularity, allowing you to create tailored solutions for a wide variety of challenges.

Whether it's clustering, deep learning, natural language processing, or reinforcement learning, the modularity of OpenGate Recipes makes it straightforward to create and manage diverse tasks.

- **Seamless Community Collaboration**: With a community-driven approach, new recipes can be easily shared, peer-reviewed, and integrated into your existing workflow, making OpenGate Recipes an ever-evolving repository of best practices.

- **Ease of Setup and Deployment**: Ready to use out of the box, OpenGate Recipes can be configured and deployed quickly, with minimal overhead. Users can get started in minutes, rapidly prototyping, testing, and iterating on machine learning models.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started, you can install OpenGate Recipes as a Python package:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/carlosprados/opengate-ai-recipes.git
```

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install mlflow numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

### Usage

OpenGate Recipes follows a simple yet flexible command-line interface that allows you to define and execute your custom workflows.

To run a predefined recipe:

```bash
direwolf-recipes run --recipe new_custom_recipe_name
```

You can create and add your own recipes by following the template available in the `recipes/` directory:

```bash
recipes/
  |- custom_recipe_template/
      |- steps/
          |- ingest.py
          |- transform.py
          |- train.py
          |- evaluate.py
      |- recipe.yaml
```

### Creating a New Recipe

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/carlosprados/opengate-ai-recipes.git
   ```

2. **Define Your Recipe Steps**:
   - Add your specific logic in the `steps/` directory.
   - Use the existing `recipe.yaml` as a starting point to define the workflow sequence.

3. **Run Your Recipe**:
   ```bash
   opengate-ai-recipes run --recipe your_new_recipe_name
   ```
